![image](https://github.com/abuseofnotation/fediscope/assets/4872512/f0fdb1ab-c690-4df1-9aa6-6b0ad9ead1e6)

Shows contents from different instances side-by-side.

Works locally on your machine, no server, no data is sent anywhere.
You can put your Mastodon handle, including the server, and all the links to posts and profiles would open up correctly.

Here is what the tabs contain:
* **Popular**: Content from popular Mastodon instances.
* **Following**: See the instances of the people you are following (works only if you type your instance).
* **Favorites**: You can pin some instances in this tab.
